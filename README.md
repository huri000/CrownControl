## Overview

Inspired by Apple Watch Digital Crown, CrownControl is a tiny accessory view that makes scrolling through scrollable content possible without lifting your thumb.


### Features

The crown consists of background and foreground surfaces. 
The foreground is an indicator which spins around the center as the attached scroll view offset changes.

- [x] Can be repositioned either using force touch or long press.
- [x] Can be spinned clockwise and counter clockwise.
- [x] Most of the user interaction actions are configurable.
- [x] The background and foreground sizes are configurable.
- [x] Can be fully stylized.

## Example Project

The example project contains samples where each demonstrates the CrownControl usability in a scrollable context.

## Requirements

- iOS 9 or any higher version.
- Swift 4.2 or any higher version.
- CrownControl leans heavily on [QuickLayout](https://github.com/huri000/QuickLayout) - A lightwight library written in Swift that is used to easily layout views programmatically.

## Installation

### CocoaPods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate CrownControl into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, specify it in your `Podfile`:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/cocoapods/specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'CrownControl', '1.0.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

## Usage

### Quick Usage

Using `CrownControl` is really simple.

In your view:

1. Define and bind `CrownAttributes` to a scroll view instance, and optionally customize the attributes.
2. Instantiate and bind the `CrownControl` instance to the `CrownAttributes` instance.
3. Setup the `CrownControl` instance in a given superview using constraints to determine its position.

```Swift

private var crownControl: CrownControl!
private var scrollView: UIScrollView!

private func setupCrownViewController() {
    let attributes = CrownAttributes(scrollView: scrollView, scrollAxis: .vertical)
    
    // Cling the bottom of the crown to the bottom of a view with -50 offset
    let verticalConstraint = CrownAttributes.AxisConstraint(crownEdge: .bottom, anchorView: scrollView, anchorViewEdge: .bottom, offset: -50)
    
    // Cling the trailing edge of the crown to the trailing edge of a view with -50 offset
    let horizontalConstraint = CrownAttributes.AxisConstraint(crownEdge: .trailing, anchorView: scrollView, anchorViewEdge: .trailing, offset: -50)

    // Setup the crown control within *self*
    crownControl = CrownControl(attributes: attributes, delegate: self)
    crownControl.layout(in: view, horizontalConstaint: horizontalConstraint, verticalConstraint: verticalConstraint)
}
```

To make the crown respond to scrolling events that emanates from any other invoker but the crown, add to `scrollViewDidScroll(_:)` the following:

```Swift
func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
    crownControl?.spinToMatchScrollViewOffset()
}
```

### Crown Attributes

`CrownAttributes` is the crown appearance descriptor. 
Its nested properties describe the look and feel of the crown.

#### Scroll Axis

The axis of the scroll view is a `.horizontal` or `.vertical`. It must be set during `CrownAttributes` initialization.

####  Anchor Position

The anchor position of the foreground indicator. Indicates where the foreground is initially positioned.

```Swift
attributes.anchorPosition = .left
```

The posssible values are `.left`, `.right`, `.top`, `.bottom`.
The default value is `.top`.

#### Spin Direction

The direction to which the the indicator spins.

Example for setting the spin direction to be counter-clockwise.
```Swift
attributes.spinDirection = .counterClockwise
```

The default value is `clockwise`.

#### User Interaction

Describes the user interaction with the crown.
Currently supported user interaction gestures: tap, double tap, long-press, and force-touch events.

##### Tap Gestures

When a single tap event occurs, scroll forward with the specified offset value: 
```Swift
attributes.userInteraction.singleTap = .scrollsForwardWithOffset(value: 20)
```

When a single tap event occurs, perform a custom action. 
```Swift
attributes.userInteraction.singleTap = .custom(action: {
    /* Do something */
})
```

When a double tap event occurs, scroll to the leading edge of the scroll view. 
```Swift
attributes.userInteraction.doubleTap = .scrollsToLeadingEdge
```

##### Drag and Drop

The crown can be dragged and dropped using force-touch if the force-touch trait is supported by the device hardware. If not, there is a fallback to long-press gesture.
```Swift
attributes.repositionGesture = .prefersForceTouch(attributes: .init())
```

#### Style

The background and foreground surfaces can be customized with various styles.

Example for setting the crown background to a gradient style, and its border to a specific color and width. 
```Swift
attributes.backgroundStyle.content = .gradient(gradient: .init(colors: [.white, .gray], startPoint: .zero, endPoint: CGPoint(x: 1, y: 1)))
attributes.backgroundStyle.border = .value(color: .gray, width: 1)
```

#### Sizes

Describes the size of the crown and relations between the foreground and the background surfaces. 

In the following example, setting `scrollRelation` property to 10 means that 10 full spins of the foreground would make the scroll view offset reach its trailing edge.
```Swift
attributes.sizes.scrollRelation = 10
```

Example for setting the edge size (width and height) of the crown to 60pts, and the foreground edge ratio to 25 precent of that size, which is 15pts.
```Swift
attributes.sizes.backgroundSurfaceDiameter = 60
attributes.sizes.foregroundSurfaceEdgeRatio = 0.25
```

#### Feedback

Feedback descriptor for the foreground when it reaches the anchor point on the crown surface.

The device generates impact-haptic-feedback when the scroll-view offset reaches the leading edge.
The background surface of the crown flashes with color.
```Swift
attributes.feedback.leading.impactHaptic = .light
attributes.feedback.leading.backgroundFlash = .active(color: .white, fadeDuration: 0.3)
```
